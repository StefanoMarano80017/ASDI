DIGITAL SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE

This folder contains material for the “integrated digital systems architectures” (ASDI) course at Federico II University. Each folder contains material produced for a specific course topic.

They are projects developed in VHDL of combinatorial and sequential machines, where the nodes are characterized by an operational part and a control part, developed in wired logic.
In addition to the simpler machines, there are also some interfaces where the goal is to make two or more nodes communicate using hanshaking protocols with serial or parallel communication.
